# FCE
FCE or Flexible Configuration Engine is as it's name suggests a configuration tool.

Unlike other configuration tools it is more flexible on what you can use it for and doesn't add any restrictions.

Some examples of use cases for this tool are as follows:

- Usual configuration of a system and software installed on it.
- Ability to setup VMLab templates in a more robust way then a generic PowerShell script.
- Ability to build a simple SOE image and manage the whole process from Windows PE to system boot.
- Ability to manage resources in a cloud environment like Azure or AWS.

# Installation
Installation is very simple. Take a copy of the latest config.ps1 file from the release section and put it in a folder you want to create the configuration in.

Then create a config.csx file which will hold your configuration.

Please see the wiki on this repository for further details on how to use the tool.
